       "   'selftext': 'I find it interesting how people have very mixed reactions to the LSOGC being the worse thing ever v.s. the LSOGC being a big help, and I\\'m wondering if it\\'s confined to the year they went to the LSOGC. \\n\\nMy theory is that most complaints were centered around 2013, 2014, which was the time when sir Gatmaitan was the director of the office. I have been seeing a lot of complaints of students during this time. According to Guidon, some changes were also trying to be implemented during that we can still see today e.g. Guidance tests are now screening for students\\' struggles that they may need help with instead of just plain old personality tests that don\\'t really help while others never made it e.g. the online guidance tests.\\n\\nAaide from this, a look through the defunct facebook page of the old Ateneo Guidance shows pictures of people, which includes many who are no longer working in the LSOGC. I have also watched a music video they posted in youtube, introducing all the staff, and again, I only found maybe 4 familiar faces left in LSOGC, 2019-2020.\\n\\nAt around 2016, sir Gary Faustino became the director of the LSOGC, and while I am unclear as to what changes were made. My guess is that at around the same time, the LSOGC was getting a face-lift. By \"face-lift\", I mean that perhaps they were finally listening to all the negative reviews of the students and getting rid of some of the staff that were causing such problems. And these were BIG problems. I\\'m talking about counselors invalidating depression i.e. \"Why are you depressed if you have money and go to a good school? And other problems like breaking confidentiality (while I believe that breaking confidentiality is important when a student poses a direct risk of hurting themselves or others, there is a difference between discussing suicidal thoughts and actually having a concrete plan.)\\n\\nNow in 2019-2020, when I visited the LSOGC, I had significantly good experiences that didn\\'t seem to quite match the bad experiences I found online. And it isn\\'t because I\\'m a perfect client. I am suicidal a lot but my therapist has never broken confidentiality once because he understands that I have no concrete plan to get there. They\\'re just thoughts and emotions for now. So, we just discuss them instead. \\n\\nThe first day I ever went to the LSOGC, I asked for a room to cry in because I was so overwhelmed, and they never laughed at me.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying this to invalidate others\\' experiences because if you have had a negative experience with the LSOGC, that is a terrible experience and you have a every right to be angry.\\n\\nBut I also want to open this discussion up to speculation. Perhaps it was the staff around those years 2013, 2014 (and even further before that because my former psychologist who\\'s around 30yrs old told me that the Guidance Office SUCKED A LOT when he was a student,) was causing these problems, so this was an ongoing problem in the past. But maybe the current LSOGC has \"improved\"?\\n\\nAnd perhaps the current LSOGC might be \"better\" than before.\\n\\nI\\'d like to hear your thoughts but also your experiences. Kindly indicate what year that negative or positive experience was.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t agree with my speculation, kindly give a comment as to why. I\\'d like to get as much comments as possible because I have so little evidence for my speculations, and I\\'ve only been in admu for such a short amount of time.\\n\\nP.S. I can also give links to certain articles of Guidon and the defunct ateneo guidance facebook page and even the music video if you ask for it below. I\\'m just currently really tired rn since it is quite late at night, and I would need to scour the internet for those specific things since I\\'m just working on my memory right now.',\n",

I could even cite some instances. \\n\\nOne was apathetic and told me, \"Basta alam mo na zero na \\'yon,\" when I told her I was facing family issues, so I missed the major quiz; another constantly berated my presentations, calling my hours of sleepless nights \"worthless\", \"ugly\", or \"irrelevant\" in front of the class, then proceed to give only one or two vague criticisms; and the worst was when one explicitly called me selfish for acting on my diagnosed depression. Other batchmates have also experienced similar incidents, if not sexual harassment, body-shaming or blatant sexism and homophobia. \\n\\nI\\'m aware that professors like these are unavoidable (they could even be the norm and maybe I\\'m just oversensitive), but I just want to know if they\\'re as rampant in Ateneo because that\\'s one major deciding factor for me to pursue my college education in this institution.

Their students consist mostly of international students from Asia and they're looking for a part-timer to help out.\\n\\nI actually had a candidate already lined up for them, but she had to back down today because of personal reasons. It was very last minute so I thought I'd open the role up for /r/ADMU in case there are students here who need part time work.\\n\\n* **What's the role?**\\n\\nThe role is for a student admin assistant. You'll help us review and update course materials (like workbooks and learner guides), prepare and format school documents, enter student information to their learning platform, and from time to time create simple marketing materials (like emails). \\n\\nYou'll work together with the Principal directly and also their trainers and get instructions and any necessary training from them as well.\\n\\nWe need someone with good attention to detail and can work independently since you'll be working remotely from home. You also have to know your way around MS office software and have good writing and verbal skills.\\n\\n* **What are the hours?**\\n\\nIt's 10-15 hours per week. I asked them to make it flexible so it's up to you how you want to divide these hours as long as it's between 7am-4pm Monday-Friday. Example: You can work 2 hours/day Monday-Friday, or 3.5 hours/day on MWF, or anything in between. What's important is you commit to a regular schedule.\\n\\n\\n* **Will I get paid?**\\n\\nOf course! It's P175/hour or P7,000/month if you do 10 hours each week (40 hours each month). \\n\\n\\n* **Interested! How do I apply?**\\n\\nSend me an email from your Ateneo/OBF email address and attach your resume (you can DM me here for the email address). Last day to send is this Sunday 16 August. \\n\\n\\n* **What if I don't have an Ateneo/OBF email address?**\\n\\nGo get one! It's free and it comes with a lot of perks. You're seriously missing out. \\n\\nHowever, I really just need it to quickly verify you're from Ateneo, so if you can't get one, then maybe send me a selfie of you at Xavier hall holding your resume. Or a screenshot of a Zoom meeting with your favorite philo prof. Or just your ID. Whatever you're comfortable with.\\n\\n\\n* **How do I write a resume?**\\n\\nReach out to the LS Placement Office and they'll give you a template and whole lot of other helpful tips. They're good people. I volunteered there when I was a sophomore until I was a senior and learned a lot from them career-wise. Also got lots of free food during their networking/career exploration events.\",\n",

COVID has taken away many opportunities and it sucks that this is what we've come to. \\n\\nMany will say that there's still post-grad, traveling someday etc, but let's be real there's no experience quite like JTA as an undergrad.
